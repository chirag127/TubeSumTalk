## ‚ú® Description

TubeSumTalk is a browser extension that automatically summarizes YouTube videos and reads the summaries aloud with word-by-word highlighting. It uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview AI to generate concise summaries from video transcripts, saving you time and helping you decide if a video is worth watching in full. You can also ask questions about the video content and get AI-generated answers based on the transcript.
