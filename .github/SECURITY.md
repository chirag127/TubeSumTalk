## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you find a security issue, please follow these steps to report it privately:

1.  **Discover:** Identify the security vulnerability.
2.  **Report:** Send an email to our dedicated security team at `security@chirag127.dev` (Note: This is a placeholder; a real project would have a dedicated security contact). Please provide as much detail as possible, including:
    *   A clear description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   The affected version(s) of the extension.
    *   Any relevant logs or screenshots.
    *   Your suggested remediation or mitigation steps.
3.  **Wait:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**. We aim to resolve valid security issues promptly and will keep you informed of our progress.
4.  **Disclosure:** We will not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been fixed and users have had a chance to update. We may also credit the reporter upon public disclosure, with their consent.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We will not pursue legal action or report to law enforcement against researchers who discover and report security vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy. We define an eligible security research activity as any effort to discover, develop, and analyze security vulnerabilities within the scope of this policy. We consider security research to be an "authorized" act and will not engage in legal action against such activity.

## Security Best Practices for Users

*   **Always use the latest version:** Ensure you have installed the most recent release of the **TubeSumTalk-YouTube-Video-Summarizer-Browser-Extension** from the official browser extension store.
*   **Be cautious of third-party integrations:** While we strive for secure integrations, always review permissions requested by any extensions and understand the data they access.
*   **Protect your Google Account:** The extension interacts with YouTube. Ensure your Google account has strong security measures enabled, including two-factor authentication.
